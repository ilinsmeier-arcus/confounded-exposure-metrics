# Introduction

## Introduction and E-R Modeling

- Exposure-response modeling usually uses a summary metric of the simulated concentrations from a PopPK model
- Often, we want a simple exposure metric for interpretability
- The choice of the exposure metric is often subject to extensive debate
  - Exposure metrics can be lead to bias E-R relationships
  - This simulation was prompted by a lengthy discussion with a client about ER modeling in the presence of both an up-titration arm and frequent dose reductions
- The goal of this simulation is to clarify  what makes a good exposure metric 

## Motivation

- Oncology setting, ADC (antibody-drug conjugate) dosed every three weeks
  - There are a several efficacy  and $\approx$ 10 safety models to develop
  - One arm is an up-titration arm, and dose reductions are somewhat common
  - Discussion with client: how to summarize exposure?
- Exposure metrics 
  - Average concentration steady state (AUCss)
  - Cycle 1 Cmax, Cavg, etc.
  - Cavg, Cmax, etc. concentration from 0 through the event (Cavg TTE)
- Related to, but *not* the same as response-driven clearance

## Examples in previous work

- ACOP Poster: "CavgTE is more frequently requested by regulatory reviewers"
- Ipatasertib: Using average dose to generate AUCss
- Metrum Projects
- Ana Ruiz published a nice tutorial paper outlining E-R modeling

# Simulation Example

## Simulation Example - Inducing a Biased Exposure-Response Relationship


## Methods 

- Simulate PK data with IIV, but no covariate effects
- Simulate E-R data with no relationship between exposure and response
- Perform, simple but typical statistical analyses
- And show that if we use certain exposure metrics we have a biased and wrong conclusion

## Typical PK Data

\includegraphics[height=3in]{../figure/typical-concentration-plot.pdf}

<!-- - 2-compartment model (pk2cmt in MRGSolve) -->
<!-- - Dosing every 3 weeks -->
<!-- - Add in IIV on clearance to simulate population data -->
<!-- - No covariates -->


## Survival Curve

- Same survival distribution for all patients
  - **No** dependence on concentration 
  - High hazard at the beginning of the study, decreasing over time
- Censoring after 6 cycles

## Data Scatterplot

Clear trend when exposures are high.

## Kaplan-Meier Analysis

Very large difference between arms, especially for Q4

## Logistic Regression Analysis

Estimated probability going from  $\approx 0$ to $\approx 1$ across the range of exposures

## Take 2: Using Cycle 1 Cavg Scatterplot

This plot already looks better

## Take 2: Using Cycle 1 K-M Curves

Confirming no relationship

## Take 2: Using Cycle 1 Logistic Regression

Also no relationship

# Discussion

## Discussion

## Model Evaluation

- Quantitative model evaluation metrics don't tell the right story 
- AIC
  - Cavg TTE: 2054
  - Cavg Cycle 1: 2774
- The Cavg TTE model also has better looking residuals
- Simulations/VPCs?

## Some DAGs

```{R,fig.height=1,fig.cap="Desired Analysis"}
d1 <- dagitty::dagitty('dag {
Exposure [exposure,pos="-0.5,-0.00"]
Response [outcome,pos="0.5,0.00"]
Exposure -> Response
}')

ggdag::ggdag(d1, layout = "circle", node_size = 18, text_size = 2.5) +
  ggdag::theme_dag() +
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.2, 0.2)))

```

```{R,fig.height=1.5,fig.cap="Cavg TTE Analysis"}
d2 <- dagitty::dagitty('dag {
Exposure [exposure,pos="-0.5,0"]
Time [time,pos="-0.0,-0.25"]
Response [outcome,pos="0.5,0"]
Response -> Time -> Exposure
}')

ggdag::ggdag(d2, layout = "circle", node_size = 18, edge_type =  "arc", text_size = 2.5) +
  ggdag::theme_dag() +
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.75, 0.75))) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.55, 0.55)))


```

## Causal Inference, DAGs, and Confounding

- The outcome should never influence a covariate/predictor
  - I.e. two patients with the exact same concentration trajectory must have the same exposure metric
  - Be careful when incorporating information about when an event happened/censoring (e.g. dosing in simulations)
- Think about which way the arrows of causality are going in the model
- Hypothetical censoring, or lack of censoring can be a useful thought exercise 
- Designing your "target trial"

## Other Alternatives

- Cycle 1 (2, 3, steady state) exposures
- Piecewise model, different exposure in each cycle
- Full longitudinal exposure in model
- Markov Model

##  Conclusions

- Average concentration through the event isn't a good choice of exposure metrics
- Confounding by using the outcome as a predictor can arise in subtle ways
- Non-biased model might be substantially more complicated
